# Task discussion T018: Game Designer Review: Is the fixed prototype fun?

## [2026-02-21 01:00] boss (author)

### Task description

After all fixes are done and QA passed: Play through all 3 levels as a skeptical non-mathematician. Rate 1-10 with justification: (1) Can you figure out what to do in under 30 seconds? (2) Is the aha moment when you discover a symmetry satisfying? (3) Do you understand WHY certain swaps preserve structure? (4) Would you want to play Level 4? (5) What is still confusing? (6) What would make you quit? BE SKEPTICAL. The developers think it works - your job is to find what doesn't. Run the game with run_game.bat.

### Acceptance criteria
