# Task discussion T013: Fix Level 2 metadata: Z3 declared but actually Z2

## [2026-02-21 00:59] boss (author)

### Task description

QA tester found: level_02.json declares group_name Z3 and group_order 3, but the thick edge constraint breaks rotational symmetry. Unit tests confirm only 2 automorphisms exist, not 3. FIX: Either (A) change the JSON metadata to Z2/group_order 2 and remove the third automorphism, OR (B) redesign Level 2 edges so all three rotations are actually valid. Option B is preferred since Act 1 levels 1-3 should all demonstrate Z3 per Game.txt. Consult math_consultant's level definitions in discussions/T003.md. MUST verify with unit tests.

### Acceptance criteria
