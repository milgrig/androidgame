# Task discussion T016: Add visual feedback explaining WHY a swap failed

## [2026-02-21 00:59] boss (author)

### Task description

Current problem: when a swap results in an invalid permutation, crystals just dim and reset. Player has no idea WHY it failed. Was it the colors? The edge types? FIX: After an invalid permutation, briefly highlight the edges/nodes that would be violated. For example: flash the mismatched edges in red, or show a brief tooltip 'Edge types don't match after this swap'. This teaches the player what 'preserving structure' means. Keep it subtle and visual, not text-heavy. MUST test by running the game.

### Acceptance criteria
