# Task discussion T014: Add onboarding tutorial for Level 1

## [2026-02-21 00:59] boss (author)

### Task description

Current problem: players (including the game creator) cannot figure out what to do. No instructions, no tutorial, no visual cues. The 30-second hint timer is far too long. FIX: (1) Show a brief tutorial overlay on Level 1 start: 'Drag crystals onto each other to swap them. Find all symmetries that preserve the structure.' (2) Add pulsing arrow or glow on crystals to indicate they are draggable. (3) Reduce first hint timer from 30s to 10s. (4) After first valid symmetry, show encouraging message explaining what happened. (5) Add visual indicator for the Reset and Test buttons from T011/T012. Keep it minimal - not a wall of text. The player should learn through doing, with gentle nudges. MUST test by running the game and verifying a non-mathematician can understand what to do.

### Acceptance criteria
