## [2026-02-21 00:01] boss (author)

### Task description

Play through levels 1-3 as a skeptical non-mathematician player. Answer honestly: 1) Can you figure out what to do without instructions? 2) Is the aha moment achievable? 3) Is the visual feedback satisfying? 4) Would you want to continue to level 4? 5) What confused you? Write detailed review with specific problems and suggestions. BE SKEPTICAL - do not just say everything is great.

### Acceptance criteria
