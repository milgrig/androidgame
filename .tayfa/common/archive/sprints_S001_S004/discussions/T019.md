## [2026-02-21 01:00] boss (author)

### Task description

After all fixes and QA: Launch the game with run_game.bat and evaluate as the harshest judge. (1) Visual quality 1-10: are crystals beautiful or generic? Is the glow effect impressive or cheap? (2) Animation smoothness 1-10 (3) Game feel 1-10: is discovering a symmetry satisfying? (4) Tutorial quality 1-10 (5) Overall 1-10: would this survive on Steam Early Access? (6) Top 3 weaknesses. Compare to Monument Valley, Baba Is You, The Witness. YOU MUST ACTUALLY RUN THE GAME. Previous critic review was done by reading code - that is unacceptable.

### Acceptance criteria
