# Task discussion T012: CRITICAL: Make identity permutation discoverable

## [2026-02-21 00:59] boss (author)

### Task description

Current bug: the identity permutation [0,1,2] is a valid symmetry that must be found to complete levels. But identity means 'do nothing' - and there is no way to submit 'do nothing' as an action. The code skips self-drops (from_id == to_id: return). FIX: Add a 'Test Current Pattern' button in the HUD that validates the current arrangement as-is. When the player clicks it at the starting position, identity [0,1,2] is discovered. This also helps players understand that 'doing nothing' is itself a symmetry. MUST test by running the game.

### Acceptance criteria

[To be clarified]
