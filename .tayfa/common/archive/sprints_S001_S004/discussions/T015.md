# Task discussion T015: Replace cycle notation with friendly names in key ring display

## [2026-02-21 00:59] boss (author)

### Task description

Current problem: when a symmetry is found, the key ring shows cycle notation like '(0 1 2)' which is meaningless to non-mathematicians. The level JSON already has friendly names: 'Identity', 'Rotation 120 degrees', 'Rotation 240 degrees'. FIX: The _update_keyring_display() function already looks up display names from target_perm_names, but verify this works correctly. Also show the description field from JSON. Example display: 'Rotation 120 - One step clockwise' instead of '(0 1 2)'. MUST test visually by running the game.

### Acceptance criteria

[To be clarified]
