# Task discussion T099: QA: Test Layer 3 keyring assembly on all group types

## [2026-02-27 22:08] boss (author)

### Task description

CONTEXT: Layer 3 fully implemented (T097 engine + T098 UI).

TASK:
1. Run all unit tests: pytest tests/fast/unit/ -v — all must pass
2. Test Layer 3 on at least 6 levels:
   - Z3 (level_01): 2 subgroups ({e}, Z3) — trivial only
   - Z4 (level_04): 3 subgroups ({e}, Z2, Z4)
   - D4 (level_05): many subgroups including non-trivial
   - S3 (level_09): 6 subgroups with interesting structure
   - Z5 (level_10): prime order — only trivial subgroups
   - S4 or A4: complex subgroup lattice
3. For each level verify:
   - Correct number of keyring slots shown
   - Drag-and-drop works (copy keys to keyring)
   - Auto-validation fires on each change
   - Valid subgroup locks the keyring
   - Duplicate subgroup rejected
   - Trivial subgroups ({e} and G) findable
   - Completion triggers when all found
   - Split-screen layout correct
   - Gold color scheme applied
4. Regression: Layers 1 and 2 still work
