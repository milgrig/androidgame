## [2026-02-28 10:18] boss (author)

### Task description

CONTEXT: Layer 4 (red) — player tests if subgroups are normal via conjugation ghg-1. REQUIREMENTS: 1) For each keyring H from Layer 3, player determines normal or not. 2) Interface: keyring H on left, lockpicks G-H on right. 3) Three-slot maneuver zone: [g] [h] [g-1 auto-filled] then EXECUTE. 4) Crystal animation shows g*h*g-1 step by step. 5) ghg-1 in H = green glow, ghg-1 not in H = RED CRACK. 6) Non-normal: find ONE cracking pair. 7) Normal: try enough pairs (min 1 per h in H), then press Unbreakable button. 8) Wrong claim = counterexample. 9) All keyrings tested = Layer 4 complete. 10) Red color scheme. TASK: 1) Design cracking UI layout. 2) Design three-slot maneuver with crystal animation. 3) Design Unbreakable button with thresholds. 4) Design data model and save/restore. 5) Handle edge cases (trivial, prime order, Q8 all-normal). REFS: redesign.md 3.5, T095, T103. DELIVERABLE: .tayfa/architect/T104_LAYER4_ARCHITECTURE.md
