### Task description

CONTEXT: New levels 13-24 implemented (T084). Need mathematical verification.\n\nTASK:\n1. For each new level, verify the automorphism group is correct\n2. Verify that all generators listed actually generate the full group\n3. Verify the group order matches expected\n4. Check that the graph structure is valid (no contradictions in edge types/colors)\n5. Run verify_automorphisms.py on new levels\n6. Verify that these graphs have interesting properties for future layers (subgroups, normal subgroups)\n\nDELIVERABLE: Verification report in .tayfa/math_consultant/T085_VERIFICATION.md

### Acceptance criteria
