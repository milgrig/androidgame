# Task discussion T083: Math consultant: design 8-12 new levels for Layer 1 (expand from 12 to 20-24 levels)

### Task description

CONTEXT: Currently Layer 1 has only 12 levels covering groups Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5, Z6, V4, D4, S3. This is too few for a full game layer. We need 8-12 MORE levels.\n\nTASK:\n1. Review existing 12 levels (data/levels/act1/level_01.json to level_12.json) to understand current coverage\n2. Design 8-12 NEW levels that:\n   - Introduce new groups not yet covered (e.g. Z7, Z8, D3, D5, D6, A4, Q8 quaternion group, etc.)\n   - Vary graph structures (trees, cycles, complete graphs, bipartite, petersen, etc.)\n   - Create interesting pedagogical progression\n   - Include varied difficulty (some easier, some harder than current levels)\n3. For each new level provide:\n   - Graph structure (nodes, edges with colors and types)\n   - Target automorphism group with all generators\n   - Expected number of automorphisms (keys)\n   - Difficulty rating (1-5)\n   - Brief pedagogical note (what does player learn here?)\n4. Output as JSON specs compatible with existing level format\n5. Consider the redesign.md architecture: these same levels will be replayed on Layers 2-5 with different tasks, so choose graphs that have interesting subgroups and normal subgroups for later layers\n\nREFERENCES:\n- Existing levels: data/levels/act1/\n- redesign.md sections 0-1 (layer architecture)\n- Game.txt for original level design ideas\n\nDELIVERABLE: Detailed specification for each new level in .tayfa/math_consultant/T083_NEW_LEVELS_SPEC.md + JSON files ready for implementation
