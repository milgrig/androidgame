# Task discussion T113: Rename 'обратный ключ' to 'зеркальный ключ' + show mirror keys in key_bar on all layers

### Task description

CONTEXT: Product owner wants consistent terminology and visual feedback across all layers.

PART 1 — RENAME:
Replace all occurrences of 'обратный ключ' / 'inverse key' with 'зеркальный ключ' / 'mirror key' in:
- All GDScript files (comments, string literals, variable names where user-facing)
- All UI text / labels / buttons
- All test descriptions
- All documentation (redesign.md references can stay as-is — it is a design doc)
- Discussion files are historical — do NOT change

PART 2 — MIRROR KEY DISPLAY IN KEY_BAR:
Once a mirror key is discovered (Layer 2 completed for a level), show the mirror key info in key_bar on ALL subsequent layers:
- Layer 1: keys only (no mirrors — not discovered yet)
- Layer 2: as player finds mirrors, they appear
- Layer 3+: key_bar shows each key WITH its mirror key indicated (e.g., small mirrored icon, or 'K1 ↔ K3' label, or mirror key color dot below)
- Self-inverse keys: special indicator (e.g., mirror symbol on the key itself)

The exact visual is up to developer_ui, but the key principle: once you know a key's mirror, that info persists and is visible in all future layers.

VERIFICATION:
- No occurrences of 'обратный ключ' in user-facing text
- 'зеркальный ключ' used everywhere
- Key_bar on Layer 3+ shows mirror key info
- Tests pass

### Acceptance criteria
