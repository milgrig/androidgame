# Task discussion T095: Math consultant: subgroup catalog for all 24 levels

## [2026-02-27 22:07] boss (author)

### Task description

CONTEXT: Layer 3 requires finding ALL subgroups (including trivial {e} and G itself) for each level.

TASK:
1. For each of the 24 levels, compute the complete list of subgroups
2. For each subgroup provide:
   - Set of keys (by their sym_ids from the level JSON)
   - Order (number of elements)
   - Is it trivial? ({e} or whole group)
   - Generator set (minimal set of keys that generate this subgroup)
   - Is it normal? (for future Layer 4)
3. Total count of subgroups per level (this determines number of keyring slots)
4. Flag levels where the number of subgroups might be too large for comfortable gameplay (>10)
5. Consider: for levels with very many subgroups, should we limit to non-trivial? (Report to boss)
