## [2026-02-27 21:08] boss (author)

### Task description

CONTEXT: Layer 2 has been completely redesigned (T092).

TASK:
1. Run all unit tests: pytest tests/fast/unit/ -v — all must pass
2. Test Layer 2 on at least 6 levels covering different group types:
   - Small group (Z2 or Z3) — few keys, easy to verify
   - Medium group (Z4, D3, S3) — mix of self-inverse and paired keys
   - Large group (D4, S4) — many keys, complex pairing
3. For each level verify:
   - Room map is visible and works (same as Layer 1)
   - All keys visible from start
   - Crystal dragging disabled
   - No target preview shown
   - Pressing key A then key B returning to Home detects pair
   - Self-inverse keys properly detected and marked
   - Paired keys visually grouped in KeyBar
   - Completion triggers when all keys paired
4. Verify key names are numbers + colors (NOT r1, e, sh)
5. Regression: Layer 1 still works normally

DELIVERABLE: QA report in .tayfa/qa_tester/T093_QA_REPORT.md
