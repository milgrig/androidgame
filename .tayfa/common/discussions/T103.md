# Task discussion T103: Math consultant: normality catalog — classify all subgroups as normal/non-normal

## [2026-02-28 10:17] boss (author)

### Task description

CONTEXT: T095 already computed all subgroups with is_normal flags. Layer 4 needs a gameplay-oriented catalog.

TASK:
1. Review T095_subgroups_data.json — verify is_normal flags are correct for all 24 levels
2. For each level, produce a Layer 4 gameplay guide:
   - List of CRACKABLE keyrings (non-normal subgroups) with example conjugation witnesses: specific (g, h) where ghg⁻¹ ∉ H
   - List of UNBREAKABLE keyrings (normal subgroups)
   - Minimum number of conjugation attempts needed to be convincing (at least one per h in H)
3. Classify levels by Layer 4 difficulty:
   - TRIVIAL: prime order groups (Z2, Z3, Z5, Z7) — all subgroups are trivially normal, auto-complete or skip
   - EASY: abelian groups (Z4, V4, Z6, Z8) — all subgroups normal, player just confirms
   - MEDIUM: groups with clear normal/non-normal split (D3, D4, D5, A4)
   - HARD: large groups with many subgroups (S4, D6, D4xZ2)
   - SPECIAL: Q8 — all subgroups normal despite being non-abelian (pedagogical highlight!)
4. For TRIVIAL levels — recommend: should player still play Layer 4, or auto-complete?
5. Identify boss fight levels for Layer 4 (S4 with only A4 and V4 normal out of 30 subgroups)
