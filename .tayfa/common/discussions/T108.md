# Task discussion T108: Game designer: Layer 4 instruction texts, hints, and pedagogical flow

## [2026-02-28 10:19] boss (author)

### Task description

CONTEXT: Layer 4 introduces the concept of normal subgroups through conjugation. This is the hardest conceptual leap so far. TASK: 1) Write instruction panel texts for Layer 4: title, goal description, mechanic explanation in simple Russian. Key metaphor: keyring cracking = testing if a subset is protected against conjugation attacks. 2) Design hint progression for Echo system: Hint 1 (direction) — try picking g and h from different sides. Hint 2 (structure) — look at elements that commute vs those that dont. Hint 3 (solution) — for non-normal show the cracking witness. 3) Write the Unbreakable confirmation text and wrong-claim feedback. 4) Design the completion summary for Layer 4: what insight should the player take away? (Some subsets are immune to conjugation — these are normal subgroups). 5) Special text for Q8 level (all normal despite non-abelian). 6) Special text for prime-order auto-complete levels.
