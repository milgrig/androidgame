# Task discussion T109: Inject layer_4 data into all 24 level JSONs

### Task description

CONTEXT: T103 normality catalog + T105 engine define the data format. TASK: 1) Read the normality catalog from T103. 2) For each of the 24 level JSONs (data/levels/act1/level_01.json through level_24.json), add a layer_4 section inside layers: containing: list of subgroups to test with is_normal flag, min_attempts threshold for unbreakable claim, difficulty classification (trivial/easy/medium/hard/special), conjugation witnesses for non-normal subgroups (example g,h pairs). 3) For trivial levels (prime order Z2,Z3,Z5,Z7): set auto_complete: true. 4) For filtered levels (S4, D6, D4xZ2): use the same filtered subgroup list as Layer 3. 5) Validate all JSONs still load correctly. 6) Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. VERIFICATION: All 24 JSONs have valid layer_4 sections. Existing tests still pass.
