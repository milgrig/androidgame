# Task discussion T111: Remove trivial key (identity/e) from all layers

## [2026-03-01 16:19] boss (author)

### Task description

CONTEXT: The identity key (e / тождество / key 0 / Home) clutters the key bar. It does nothing — pressing it leaves crystals unchanged. It should be removed from player-visible UI on ALL layers.

TASK:
1. Layer 1: Do NOT show identity key in key_bar. It should not be discoverable as a 'key'. The Home room still exists on the room map, but there is no key for it.
2. Layer 2: Identity is self-inverse — skip it from pairing. Do not show it as a key to pair.
3. Layer 3: Identity should not appear in the key pool for dragging into keyrings. Subgroups are defined by non-trivial keys only (but internally {e} is always implicit in any subgroup).
4. Layer 4: Identity should not appear in the conjugation UI.
5. Update key_ring.gd / key_bar.gd: filter out identity permutation from display.
6. Update inverse_pair_manager.gd: skip identity from pairing.
7. Update keyring_assembly_manager.gd: identity is implicit, not shown.
8. Update all tests that reference identity key.
9. Room map: Home room (room 0) can still be shown as starting point, but no key button for it.

IMPORTANT: Identity MUST still exist internally in the math engine (permutation.gd, SubgroupChecker, etc.) — only remove from UI/display.

VERIFICATION:
- Key bar never shows identity/e/key 0
- Room map still shows Home room
- Layer 2 pairing skips identity
- Layer 3 keyrings don't include identity in drag pool
- All math still works internally
- Tests pass
